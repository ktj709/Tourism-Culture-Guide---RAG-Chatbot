# Tourism & Culture Guide RAG Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that answers tourism-related questions using curated data from Wikipedia (via scraping), tourism PDFs, and text sources. 
Built with Python, LangChain, FAISS, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash.

# How This Project Works

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that answers tourism-related queries for Delhi, Mumbai, and Jaipur (with the flexibility to easily add more cities in the future). It works by first collecting tourism information from sources like Wikipedia and city tourism websites (scraping), cleaning the text, and converting it into vector embeddings stored in a FAISS database. When a user asks a question, the query is embedded, relevant information is retrieved from FAISS, and then passed to Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (or another LLM) to generate accurate, context-aware responses.


# Features

Fetches tourism and cultural data from:

    Wikipedia articles

    Tourism brochures (PDF)

    Plain text URLs

Chunks and embeds documents using FAISS

Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM for generating context-aware answers

Supports multiple cities in one searchable index

Can run entirely locally (LLM call still requires internet)

# Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

8GB+ RAM (Recommended: 16GB)

Google Gemini API key

# Installation


git clone https://github.com/ktj709/Tourism-Culture-Guide---RAG-Chatbot

cd Tourism-Culture-Guide---RAG-Chatbot

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory:

     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here


# Running the Project

python main.py

# Once running, type your tourism question, e.g.:

"Best cultural festivals in Jaipur"

"Top 3 museums in Mumbai"

"Traditional food to try in Delhi"

# Adding New Cities

Edit the cities list in main.py:
     for example:

       cities = [
    {
        "name": "Paris",
        "wiki": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris",
        "pdf": ["any pdf having relevant data.pdf"],
        "text_url": None
    }
    ]


# Some important points

Current Cities: The dataset currently includes only Delhi, Mumbai, and Jaipur.

      Easy Expansion: Adding more cities is simple:

        Add the new cityâ€™s details in the cities list in main.py.

        Provide the city name, a valid Wikipedia link (optional), and at least one tourism-related PDF containing relevant data about that city.

        Run the ingestion pipeline again to rebuild the FAISS index.

        Document Sources: The RAG pipeline supports PDFs, Wikipedia articles, and plain-text URLs.

        Custom Data: You can mix and match multiple data sources per city â€” the retrieval system will merge them into one searchable index.
